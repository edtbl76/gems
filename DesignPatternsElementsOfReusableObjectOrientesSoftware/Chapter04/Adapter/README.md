# Adapter

## Intent

Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Also Known As

Wrapper

## Applicability

* you want to use an existing class, and its interface does not match the one you need
* you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes, that is, classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces
* *(object adapter only)* you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's unpractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class

## Structure

A class adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another:

An object adapter relies on object composition:

## Participants

* **`Target`**: defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses
* **`Client`**: collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface
* **`Adaptec`**: defines an existing interface that needs adapting
* **`Adapter`**: adapts the interface of Adaptec to the Target interface

## Collaborations

*Client*s call operations on an *Adapter* instance. In turn, the adapter calls *Adaptee* operations that carry out the request.

## Consequences

* A class adapter
  - adapts Adaptee to Target by committing to a concrete Adaptee class. As a consequence, a class adapter won't work when we want to adapt a class *and* all its subclasses
  - lets Adapter override some of Adaptee's behavior, since Adapter is a subclass of Adaptee
  - introduces only one object, and no additional pointer indirection is needed to get to the adaptee
* An object adapter
  - lets a single Adapter work with many Adapteesâ€”that is, the Adaptee itself and all of its subclasses (if any). The Adapter can also add functionality to all Adaptees at once
  - makes it harder to override Adaptee behavior. It will require subclassing Adaptee and making Adapter refer to the subclass rather than the Adaptee itself
