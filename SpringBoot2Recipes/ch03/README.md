# Chapter 3: Spring MVC

Spring Boot will automatically configure a web application when it finds the classes on the classpath. It will also start an embedded server (by default it will launch an embedded Tomcat).

## 3.1 Getting Started with Spring MVC

**Problem**

How to use Spring Boot to power a Spring MVC application?

**Solution**

Spring Boot will do auto-configuration for the components needed for Spring MVC. To enable this, Spring Boot needs to be able to detect the Spring MVC classes on its classpath. For this, the spring-boot-starter-web needs to be added as a dependency.

## 3.2 Exposing REST Resources with Spring MVC

**Problem**

How to use Spring MVC to expose REST based resources `@WebMvcTest`.

**Solution**

A JSON library is needed to do the JSON marshalling (although XML and other formats could be used as well, as content negotiation 3 is part of REST). The `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency already includes the needed Jackson libraries by default.

## 3.3 Using Thymeleaf with Spring Boot

**Problem**

How to use Thymeleaf to render the pages of the application?

**Solution**

The dependency for Thymeleaf needs to be added and a regular `@Controller` has to be created to determine the view and fill the model.

## 3.4 Handling Exceptions

**Problem**

How to customize the default white label error page shown by Spring Boot.

**Solution**

An additional `error.html` must be added as a customized error page, or specific error pages for specific HTTP error codes (i.e., `404.html` and `500.html`).

## 3.5 Internationalizing Your Application

**Problem**

When developing an internationalized web application, the web pages have to be displayed in a userâ€™s preferred locale. It's never wanted to create different versions of the same page for different locales.

**Solution**

To avoid creating different versions of a page for different locales, the web pages should be made independent of the locale by externalizing locale-sensitive text messages. Spring is able to resolve text messages by using a message source, which has to implement the `MessageSource` interface. In the page templates it can be used either special tags or do lookups for the messages.
