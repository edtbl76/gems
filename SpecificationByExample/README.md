# Specification by Example

Main notes taken from the book [Specification by Example: How successful teams deliver the *right* software](https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/)

## Part 1: Getting Started

### Chapter 1: Key benefits

* Building the product right and building the right product are two different things. You need to do both in order to succeed.
* *Specification by Example* provides just enough documentation at the right time, helping to build the right product with short iterations or flow-based development processes.
* *Specification by Example* helps to improve the quality of software products, significantly reduces rework, and enables teams to better align analysis, development, and testing activities.
* In the long term, *Specification by Example* helps teams create a living documentation system, a relevant and reliable description of the functionality that’s automatically updated with the programming language code.
* The practices of *Specification by Example* work best with short iterative (Scrum, Extreme Programming [XP]) or flow-based (Kanban) development methods. Some ideas are also applicable to structured development (Rational Unified Process, Waterfall) processes.

### Chapter 2: Key process patterns

* The key process patterns of *Specification by Example* are deriving scope from goals, specifying collaboratively, illustrating specifications using examples, refining the specifications, automating validation without changing the specifications, validating the system frequently, and evolving living documentation.
* With *Specification by Example*, functional requirements, specifications, and acceptance tests are the same thing.
* The result is a living documentation system that explains what the system does and that is as relevant and reliable as the programming language code but much easier to understand.
* Teams in different contexts use different practices to implement process patterns.

### Chapter 3: Living documentation

* There are several models of looking at *Specification by Example*. Different models are useful for different purposes.
* *Specification by Example* allows you to build up a good documentation system incrementally.
* *Living documentation* is an important artifact of the delivery process, as vital as code.
* Focusing on creating a business-process documentation system should help you avoid the most common long-term maintenance problems with specifications and tests.

### Chapter 4: Initiating the changes

* *Specification by Example* is a good way to provide development teams with just-in-time specifications, so it’s a key factor for success with short iterations or flow-based development.
* Handle small chunks of software efficiently to enforce quick turnaround time and feedback.
* Emphasize effective, efficient communication instead of long, boring documents.
* Integrate cross-functional teams where testers, analysts, and developers work together to build the right specification of the system.
* Plan for automation overhead upfront.

## Part 2: Key process patterns

### Chpater 5: Deriving scope from goals

* When you’re given requirements as tasks, push back: Get the information you need to understand the real problem; then collaboratively design the solution.
* If you can’t avoid getting tasks, ask for high-level examples of how they would be useful—this will help you understand who needs them and why, so you can then design the solution.
* To derive the appropriate scope, think about the business goal of a milestone and the stakeholders who can contribute or be affected by that milestone.
* Start with the outputs of a system to get the business users more engaged.
* Reorganize component teams into teams that can deliver complete features.

### Chapter 6: Specifying collaboratively
