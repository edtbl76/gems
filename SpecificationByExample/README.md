# Specification by Example

Main notes taken from the book [Specification by Example: How successful teams deliver the *right* software](https://gojko.net/books/specification-by-example/)

## Chapter 1: Key benefits

* Building the product right and building the right product are two different things. You need to do both in order to succeed.
* *Specification by Example* provides just enough documentation at the right time, helping to build the right product with short iterations or flow-based development processes.
* *Specification by Example* helps to improve the quality of software products, significantly reduces rework, and enables teams to better align analysis, development, and testing activities.
* In the long term, *Specification by Example* helps teams create a living documentation system, a relevant and reliable description of the functionality thatâ€™s automatically updated with the programming language code.
* The practices of *Specification by Example* work best with short iterative (Scrum, Extreme Programming [XP]) or flow-based (Kanban) development methods. Some ideas are also applicable to structured development (Rational Unified Process, Waterfall) processes.

## Chapter 2: Key process patterns

* The key process patterns of *Specification by Example* are deriving scope from goals, specifying collaboratively, illustrating specifications using examples, refining the specifications, automating validation without changing the specifications, validating the system frequently, and evolving living documentation.
* With *Specification by Example*, functional requirements, specifications, and acceptance tests are the same thing.
* The result is a living documentation system that explains what the system does and that is as relevant and reliable as the programming language code but much easier to understand.
* Teams in different contexts use different practices to implement process patterns.
