# Chapter 10: Classes

## Class Organization

Following the standard Java convention, a class should begin with a list of variables. Public static constants, if any, should come first. Then private static variables, followed by private instance variables.

Public functions should follow the list of variables. We like to put the private utilities called by a public function right after the public function itself.

### Encapsulation

We like to keep our variables and utility functions private, but weâ€™re not fanatic about it.

## Classes Should Be Small!
