# Chapter 3: Functions

## Small!

The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that _they should be smaller than that_.

Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.

## Blocks and Indenting

Blocks within if statements, else statements, while statements, and so on should be one line long. Probably that line should be a function call. Not only does this keep the enclosing function small, but it also adds documentary value because the function called within the block can have a nicely descriptive name.
