# Part III: More Techniques

## Chapter 14: Controlling Cucumber

Cucumber allows to choose which features and/or scenarios to run, based on tags, names, and line numbers. Using the special *rerun* plugin, we can choose to only run scenarios that failed the last time the features were executed.

There are other options that control Cucumber, such as the `glue` option (which gives us the freedom to structure our solution in the way that we want) and the `snippets` option (which gives us control of the formatting of our snippet names).

Cucumber integrates very well with JUnit, TestNG and can be ran using Ant, Mave and Gradle, including running it from a CI environment.
