# Gems

This is not intented to be used as an official reference of any kind. It is only intended to be used as a memo for myself after reading some great books which I think deserve to be kept at hand. This repo is public only because I think many people may find it useful as a summary, but, if you want to really learn about these topics, consider buying the linked books.
