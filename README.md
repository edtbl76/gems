# Effective Java - Notes

## Chapter 2. Creating and Destroying Objects

### Item 1: Consider static factory methods instead of constructors

* One advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they have names.
* A second advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they are not required to create a new object each time theyâ€™re invoked.
* A third advantage of static factory methods is that, unlike constructors, they can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
* A fourth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object can vary from call to call as a function of the input parameters.
* A fifth advantage of static factories is that the class of the returned object need not exist when the class containing the method is written.
* The main limitation of providing only static factory methods is that classes without public or protected constructors cannot be subclassed.
* A second shortcoming of static factory methods is that they are hard for programmers to find.

### Item 2: Consider a builder when faced with many constructor parameters

* The telescoping constructor pattern works, but it is hard to write client code when there are many parameters, and harder still to read it.
* A JavaBean may be in an inconsistent state partway through its construction.
* The JavaBeans pattern precludes the possibility of making a class immutable.
* The Builder pattern simulates named optional parameters.
* The Builder pattern is well suited to class hierarchies.
* The Builder pattern is a good choice when designing classes whose constructors or static factories would have more than a handful of parameters.

### Item 3: Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type

* Making a class a singleton can make it difficult to test its clients.
* A single-element enum type is often the best way to implement a singleton.

### Item 4: Enforce noninstantiability with a private constructor

* Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does not work.
* A class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor.

### Item 5: Prefer dependency injection to hardwiring resources

* Static utility classes and singletons are inappropriate for classes whose behavior is parameterized by an underlying resource.
* A better alternative to satisfy the ability to support multiple instances of the class, each of which uses the resource desired by the client, is pass the resource into the constructor when creating a new instance.
